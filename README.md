# PASSWORD RESET – Secure Authentication Interface

A modern, visually distinctive password change application built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed to provide a secure and engaging user experience, this project demonstrates creative front-end development with emphasis on UI/UX innovation, form validation, and responsive design.

---

## Overview

**Password Reset** is a standalone client-side interface that allows users to securely update their authentication credentials. Unlike conventional password change forms, this implementation features a futuristic cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic with animated effects, interactive feedback, and robust validation logic.

The application runs entirely in the browser with no external dependencies, making it ideal for learning, customization, or integration into authentication systems.
